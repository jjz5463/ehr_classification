no response to noxious stimuli the patient also had hypernatremia, which was attributed to renal failure this, along with her continued encephalopathy, prompted nephrology to pursue a trial of hd when

with continued episodes of fever differential diagnosis of fevers included endocarditis, line infections, cholecystis, wound infections and clabsi id was consulted and helped to guide therapy work-up

prior to leaving the icu, today off sedation continued to be very poor, she opened her eyes to sternal rub, and + corneals, but otherwise had no cough, gag, and no response to noxious stimuli etiology of her continued poor exam is most likely multifactorial including complicated and prolonged hospital stay with multiple metabolic derangements and infectious process with necrotizing fasciitis they felt that her prognosis was difficult to determine while the patient still had an active infection the patient received multiple courses of antibiotics with resolution of fevers also received a trial of hd without improvement in mental status neurology was again consulted, who believed the changes were likely irreversible cv the patient was weaned from pressors as tolerated the patient did go into

dressings as the flexiseal leaked and even with frequent dressing changes and readjustment, the wound's location and size made it difficult to keep clean acs and wound care continued to follow with

and a small amount of vaginal bleeding in the context of low platelets (plts 7) ct chest/abdomen/pelvis did not identify any other source of bleed no evidence of rp or thigh bleed was found on physical exam therefore, the patient was tranfused prbc to a goal hct >21 platelets remained low in spite of platelet transfusions, presumably secondary to the patient's splenomegaly gynecology recommended vaginal u/s that was done on  in the icu, the patient's neutropenia persisted throughout icu stay, but anc rose to 494 before she left the icu she was put on neutropenic precautions and treated with filgrastim she was treated with broad spectrum abx as discussed above under respiratory failure abx will be continued until anc>500 as per id the patient was thrombocytopenic throughout icu course and has been refractory to platelet transfusions after transfusion, platelets briefly rise by points, but quickly drop back to baseline of 7 this is presumed to be because of significant splenomegaly it was decided that she would be transfused plts only before procedures or in setting of active bleeding and transfusion goal was latterly set to aim for a hct>20 and plt>10 to reduce the transfusion burden due to high requirement of transfusions and lack of symptoms at this level on transfer back to floor from the micu, counts were increasing on gcsf she remained on meropenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin until she was no longer neutropenic thrombocytopenia was noted to be refractory to platelets, which were then only given when pt was showing signs of bleeding pra was negative, so refractoriness was thought to be splenomegaly after transfer to floor from micu, patient was more responsive to platelets although this was again an issue by with little increase in counts despite transfusions and having difficulty even attaining a platelet count of 20 due to absence of fevers, stopped mica, cefepime and vanc on  afebrile, no longer neutropenic had ih

infiltrate micafungin was changed to voriconazole on for coverage of aspergillus pt triggered several times for tachycardia and tachypnea related to fever and was transferred to the icu for closer monitoring the patient's neutropenia persisted throughout icu stay, but anc rose to 494 before she left the icu she was put on neutropenic precautions and treated with filgrastim she was treated with broad spectrum abx as discussed above under respiratory failure abx were continued on return to floor from icu, patient remained on meropenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin while still neutropenic she was planned to continued micafungin as an outpt at the clinic  #hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring icu transfer in the icu the patient developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, initially secondary to volume overload with flash pulmonary edema in the context of a prbc transfusion this was all likely complicated by a probable pneumonia (viral, bacterial or fungal) the patient was intubated for hypoxemic resp failure and ventilated for 12 days the patient's pneumonia was treated w/ meropenem, cipro, vanc, micafungin as per id recs and respiratory status improved she was extubated successfully on  id recommended that micafungin/meropenem be continued until anc>500 most recent granulocyte count is 494 on  the patient was given mucinex prn for cough after starting hd, the patient's fluid balance became positive and she continues to respond poorly to lasix resp status nevertheless continues to be good and she remained clinically stable in this regard on ra until episode of decompensated pulmonary edema on (see note on pulmonary edema for details)  #arf no longer dialysis dependent pt developed acutely worsening renal function after intubation and the cause was felt to be atn secondary to hypoperfusion during an episode of hypotension during intubation she developed worsening hypervolemia, hyperkalemia up to 63 and a creatinine level of 41 in spite of intravenous fluids and treatment for hyperkalemia the pt was treated w/ cvvh and volume was successfully removed over 8 days however the pt's renal function continued to be poor and the patient was switched to intermittent hd when the patient was off pressors and relatively stable she was transferred back to the floor once stable while on the floor, she was dialysed with hd as needed for fluid removal and for uremia when renal function did not significantly improve patient was noted to have altered mental status likely uremia as this improved after dialysis sessions medications were renally dosed she had a temporary dialysis line inserted on  and it was felt that uremia may be contributing to altered mental status although this was multi-factorial and resolved by early  she had bilateral effusions and r effusion worse on ct  effusions improved with aggressive diuresis although by right effusion still present and small-moderate she passed progressively higher volumes of urine and by passed 1000ml urine over 24 hrs as end of and this trended upwards fluid status improved but she still had gross pitting edema to knees bilaterally on advice of renal she was slowly started on iv furosemide boluses to help fluid status rby she no longer required dialysis after an episode of acute pulmonary edema, she as aggressively diuresed from onwards with 80-100mg iv furosemide and fluid status greatly improved with diuresis, she was clinically improving and renal function was stable dialysis line removed with platelet cover  kidney function has been stable and slowly improving  # confusion this was considered likely multifactorial given a high bili which improved, a high bun on dialysis and the possibility of infection she was treated for infectious etiologies and stopped  lfts improved but did not resolve to the normal range and she was dialysed until renal function recovered whereupon she no longer required dialysis following discontinuation of antibiotics, she

pulmonary edema tte with severe mr and preserved ejection fraction treated with diuresis as above also had left chest tube placed to drain left pleural effusion pleural fluid analysis had elevated to

including hypotension, sepsis, diuresis and other medications, recommending continuing to hold diuresis also noted that creatinine was likely underestimating degree of renal failure due to patient's muscle wasting from msa renal was also consulted for possible crrt, renal recommended not pursuing crrt given his likely requirement for future hd and his likely inability to tolerate hd going forward renal did recommend starting patient on sevelamer tid over the past week, patient's uremia has been improving with bun and cr down-trending #altered mental status patient with waxing/waning mental

acute stroke, hemorrhage or mass; showed progression of multi-system atrophy lp performed without evidence of infection home ritalin was started as patient with rising bun, uremic encephalopathy was highest on the differential renal was consulted for possible crrt as above as kidney injury improves, altered mental status may be secondary to multi-organ failure and underlying multiple system atrophy #hyperuricemia uric acid 113 urine with few uric acid crystals renal was consulted and stated that the uric acid was likely elevated renal failure, and would not cause urate cyrstals unless it

septic shock the patient developed refractory septic shock requiring 5 pressor support and fluid resucitation to 35l the source of his sepsis was thought to be his right axillary abscess he may have been predisposed to a more severe immune response on clozaril which causes agranulocytosis and perhaps a functional neutropenia ct abdomen/pelvis was unrevealing with the right axillary absess remaining the most likely source he initially received clindamycin, meropenem and vancomycin for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and high dose steroids x 3 days for refractory septic shock mssa was identified from the abscess, all other cultures were negative he was thus started on a 2 week course of nafcillin from  he was suspected of having a toxic shock syndrome due to the lack of positive blood cultures and received ivig, a toxic shock panel, and pvl testing on the mssa was performed he was eventually weaned down on his pressors and transferred to the floor when he no longer required pressor support on the floor he remained hemodynamically stable with no required interventions his i&d'd abscess site in the right axilla remained clean and dry with no evidence of reaccumulation on discharge he is afebrile and normotensive #

optic neuropathy upon extubation the patient noted bilateral visual loss mri/mra was unrevealing for an intracranial etiology evaluation by neuro-ophthalmology revealed ischemic optic neuropathy due to shock as the underlying cause of his blindness with this diagnosis the patient is unlikely to recover meaningful vision, with perhaps the possibility of light perception in the future he was registered with the registry for the blind, who will conduct an assessment in the future case management was consulted for the appropriate services at rehab and at home given his new diagnosis #

vagal episodes while intubated he had a pea arrest recovering with epinephrine he subsequnently had multiple asystolic episodes with immediate return to circulation in the setting of vagal activities such as coughing cardiology was consulted and recommended theophylline which lessened his vagal tone and the vagal episodes decreased in frequency the theophylline was stopped before transfer to the floor on the floor he required no interventions and remained in nsr with no episodes of asystole or arrhythmia # urinary retention upon transfer to the floor the patient had a foley catheter in place in order to monitor uop closely as his renal function improved, the foley was discontinued following discontinuation he had no difficulty urinating but was incontinent on he developed urinary retention, with no urination over the course of hours, and 900cc in his bladder upon bladder scan he was straight cathed with succesful drainage throughout the rest of his hospital course he was able to void spontaneously without difficulty #
